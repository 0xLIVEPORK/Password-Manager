# Password-Manager

A C++  password manager from the ground up. 

This is used as a project to gauge my skills as I learn more about c++. As of writing I have only learned c++ for 2 weeks 
with varying training time although the average time spent is less 40 minutes a day.

### Plans

- Add Encryption
- Use Fstream to generate files to store, encrypte and read from.
- A gui using FLTK or if possible a modern looking library
- Syncing
